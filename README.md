# AI-enhanced-Financial-Management-System
### Overview
This project leverages advanced AI techniques to enhance data management and integration within the realm of financial management. By utilizing machine learning models, anomaly detection algorithms, and deep learning, this project aims to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of financial data analysis and decision-making processes.

### Features
- **Anomaly Detection:** Implements Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and One-Class SVM to identify and segregate false or corrupted data.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Uses XGBoost and deep learning models to predict future financial metrics such as revenue.
- **Clustering:** Applies K-Means clustering to categorize financial data into meaningful groups.
- **Classification:** Utilizes Random Forest for binary classification tasks, such as identifying high vs. low revenue periods.
- **Data Visualization:** Provides visual representations of financial data, including anomaly detection results and predictive analytics.

### Technologies Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for data processing and model implementation.
- **Flask:** A lightweight web framework used to create the chatbot interface.
- **Pandas:** A data manipulation library used for handling and processing financial datasets.
- **Scikit-learn:** A machine learning library used for implementing various models and algorithms.
- **XGBoost:** A powerful gradient boosting framework used for regression tasks.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Deep learning libraries used for building and training neural networks.
- **Matplotlib:** A plotting library used for data visualization.

### Project Structure
- **app.py:** The main Flask application file that sets up the chatbot and integrates the machine learning models.
- **templates/index.html:** The HTML file that provides the user interface for the chatbot.
- **anomaly_data/:** A directory where anomaly data is saved for further analysis.

### How to Run
1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install flask pandas scikit-learn xgboost tensorflow keras matplotlib
   ```
2. **Run the Flask App:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. **Interact with the Chatbot:**
   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to interact with the chatbot through the HTML interface.

### Usage
- **Anomaly Detection:** The chatbot can explain the anomaly detection techniques used and provide insights into the detected anomalies.
- **Predictive Analytics:** The chatbot can predict future revenue using XGBoost and deep learning models.
- **Clustering and Classification:** The chatbot can provide information about the clustering and classification results.
